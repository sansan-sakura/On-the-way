Would you like to know how to internationalise your website without using react-118n?As a beginner
Frontend Developer, I feel that it is crucial that you try to learn to do it yourself, and to
understand how the code works. I have tried to avoid Libraries as I learn, and this has challenged
me in many ways.While completing my portfolio project as a Web Development student at Technigo (an
amazing Tech company, based in Sweden, but fully remote), and learning the basics of React and the
importance of accessibility, I decided to challenge myself by implementing multi-language
functionality. I was unaware of i18n at the time and found that it is actually quite simple to do
this without it! Let me show you how. (If you are unsure of how to set up a React project, check
out <a href="https://medium.com/@stenlisuryadinata/how-to-build-a-react-app-from-scratch-e454304d542e"> this article.</a> )

```
const [lang, setLang] = useState("en");
```

You need to have a state that holds your current language. If you know how to work with global
state management tools, like Redux, Zustand, Recoil…., you can use them. Otherwise, like old me, I
declared the state in main. jsx, which in my case was the parent. Then I passed it as a prop,
which caused a lot of prop drilling, so I do not recommend doing that.

```import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import styles from "./MultiLanguageButton.module.scss";
function MultiLanguageButton({ lang, onLang }) {
const [currentPosition, setCurrentPosition] = useState({});

function handleClick(e) {
onLang(e.target.id);
}

useEffect(() => {
if (lang === "en") setCurrentPosition({ transform: "translateX(4px)" });
if (lang === "ja") setCurrentPosition({ transform: "translateX(-38px)" });
}, [lang]);

return (

<div className={styles.btn_box}>
  <div className={styles.country_box}>
    <span>🇯🇵</span>
    <span>🇬🇧</span>
  </div>
  <div
    className={styles.outer_btn}
    aria-description="Choose a language to read, in Japanese or English."
  >
    <span className={styles.circle} style={currentPosition}></span>
    <button
      className={styles.inner_btn}
      id="ja"
      onClick={handleClick}
      aria-label="日本語で読む"
      lang="ja"
    ></button>
    <button
      className={styles.inner_btn}
      id="en"
      onClick={handleClick}
      aria-label="Read in English"
    ></button>
  </div>
</div>
); }

export default MultiLanguageButton;
```

Then you need to implement a button or similar that allows the user to change the language option.
Add an event handler to get a value, then you can set it to the state.

```
export const heroText = {
  en: " I've transitioned from a French pastry chef to a front-end developer, started to teach myself JavaScript, React, Next.js,Astro.js and CSS/SCSS in 2021 and currently enrolle in Technigo's Bootcamp to enrich my programming skills. I am passionate about writing clean, solid code, learning new things and trying new technologies. I am delving into computer science as well 💻",
  ja: "元フランス菓子のパティシエのフロントエンドエンジニアです。２０２１年からプログラミングを自分で勉強し始め、現在はスウェーデンのTechnigoというプログラミングスクールで勉強中です。プログラムが大好きで、隙間時間があればコードを書くかプロジェクトのことを考えています。私は、いかに綺麗に良いパフォーマンスのコードを書けるかを大切にしております。",
};
```

Don’t forget to consider your data structure, this will make your life easier!

```
<p className={styles.text} lang={lang}>
  {heroText[lang]}
</p>
```

When you use data, you can use state as a key. So simple, right?

```
useEffect(() => {
    document.documentElement.lang = lang;
  }, [lang]);
```

Finally, you can add useEffect to modify the html lang tag, so that accessibility is covered! You
