Today I would like to share with you my experience as a web student at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/technigo/'>Technigo</a> .I started this coding bootcamp last August and now it has been about three months.

### Technigo

a boot camp for women based in Sweden

Technigo is a fully remote web development and UX/UI design bootcamp based in Stockholm, Sweden. The most interesting/amazing thing about it is that it is a female-founded company and most of the students are female. (Of course, we also have male students!!) I thought this was amazing as most people working in the tech industry are male and more women are needed in this field.

### Application process

So when I found this bootcamp in early spring, I was so excited and applied right away. The application process was also very interesting, as I had to take some basic HTML/CSS classes and create a static and simple code pen page to submit.

(It was not difficult as they explained well in the videos what I had to do. So no worries. )

### Pre-Course

A few weeks later I found out that I had been accepted for the course, which started in mid-August. Before the actual course started, there was a pre-course where I learnt about HTML/CSS through a lot of online videos that they offered us in Notion. (By the way, this bootcamp takes place mostly in Notion. I was a bit confused at first because I hadnâ€™t used Notion before, but now Iâ€™m thankful that they use Notion because itâ€™s such a popular tool in the tech industry and I might need to use it when I start working!) There was also a homework assignment. I had to create a static news page using HTML/CSS.

Here is mine. <a href="https://tourmaline-cendol-e09256.netlify.app/">Berlin Belrin</a>

### Bootcamp

The first two days were full of lectures and lots of activities to get to know people. (Only those two days, we had full-day meetings, lectures, and other activities)

We have about 50 people in the web class and there are 5 teams. So we have about 10 people in a team. In this team, we help each other and work together. We always have one project a week that has to be handed in by midnight on Sunday, and sometimes we have pair or group projects that we have to work on with other people in the team.

We usually have two compulsory sessions with teams and two non-mandatory (as they are recorded) lectures. (One is a lecture that we learn for the week and one is a Q&A session where you can ask any questions! ) This bootcamp is not full-time but half-time. But I enjoy/appreciate this schedule as I can learn extra and do extra things! (Some people work full-time/half-time, some people commit to this bootcamp full-time, and Technigo recommends at most half-time if you work at the same time).

### Sprints

You have 5 sprints in total and each one lasts about 4 weeks. For the first one, we learned about vanilla JavaScript (we created projects like, chatbot, weather appâ€¦).

A few of my projects.

Now I have finished the third sprint and I am going to jump into sprint 4 where we will learn about Node.js (backend development. how to create API and authentication, and moreâ€¦).

Sprint 5 is for creating a final project. It has to be super fun ðŸ§š

My journey with learning programming at Technigo is great so far! Even though the online learning has some difficulties sometimes, especially in terms of communication. But people at Technigo try their best and I think this is also a good practice as sometimes you get a full remote job (I think then you are lucky!!) I feel I am learning how to communicate with people better with online plat home now. So I am happy with my decision and recommend others to study with t Technigo!

Thanks for your reading!!
