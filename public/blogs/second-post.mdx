[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a Rehype plugin powered by the
[`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter that provides beautiful code blocks for Markdown or MDX. It works on both the server at build-time (avoiding runtime syntax highlighting) and on the client for dynamic highlighting.

## Editor-Grade Highlighting

  Enjoy the accuracy and granularity of VS Code's syntax highlighting engine and the popularity of

</span>

## Line Numbers and Line Highlighting

Draw attention to a particular line of code.

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating();

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
```

}
