I heard that making a carousel from scratch was
difficult before, and I wondered if that was true. I did some research about it and found that actually,
it is fairly easy.

Moreover, it is lighter than using a library, so why not?

So I would like to share how to make one from scratch.

```
<div className="carousel">
    <ul>
        <li className="red"></li>
        <li className="green"></li>
        <li className="orange"></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

For the HTML, I need a div as a frame, and inside of the div, added an ul to store all the list items that are carousel items.

For the div, I also added ref to attach a function, so that when you click a button, it moves to the next item. I also added buttons. Now, it looks like this.

```
<div className="carousel" ref={carouselRef}>
    <ul>
        <li className="red"></li>
        <li className="green"></li>
        <li className="orange"></li>
    </ul>
    <button className="leftBtn" onClick={handleLeftClick}>
          &larr;
    </button>
    <button className="rightBtn" onClick={handleRightClick}>
          &rarr;
    </button>
 </div>


```

Then, I created functions for buttons. ( handleLeftClick and handleRightClick)

```
function handleLeftClick() {
    carouselRef.current.scrollLeft -= 200;
  }
```

```

function handleRightClick() {
carouselRef.current.scrollLeft += 200;
}

```

Here, I used a built-in JS method called scrollLeft. here is more info

Because each item has a width of 200px, I wrote 200 above, so when you create your own, you should adjust for your own needs.

Now, it is time for CSS.

For a div, I added overflow: scroll; and fixed width to only show one item.

Also, I added scroll-snap-type. This is a fantastic CSS property when you make a carousel as it prevents items from being cut. So one item will be always fully shown and not two cut items at the same time. ( For each item, you also need scroll-snap-align: start; to make this work)

As I want to hide the scroll bar, I added a webkit-scrollbar display: hidden;

```
.carousel {
  display: relative;
  width: 200px;
  overflow: scroll;
  padding: 10px;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

.carousel::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}

ul {
  display: flex;
  width: fit-content;
}

.red,
.green,
.orange {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 1px solid #444;
  list-style: none;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}

```

I added a width of fit-item and flex to ul to put items in one row.

Now, it is done. This is a simple carousel and you can add more features like pagination, a function that scrolls automatically, and more.

Here is an example that I made for this on <a href='https://codesandbox.io/s/purple-rgb-s5fz5z?file=/src/styles.css:550-731'>code sandbox</a>.

I hope it is helpful and happy coding!!
